    simple > "complex" > complicated   # Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.
    flat > nested                      # Flat is better than nested.
    sparse > dense                     # Sparse is better than dense.
    readable = good				       # Readability counts.
    rules > special cases 			   # Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    practicality > purity			   # Although practicality beats purity.

# Unless explicitly silenced.

# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
